    <p>I've always wanted to better understand computers, and also enjoyed work that I find intellectually stimulating. I also enjoy the feeling that comes from creating something from scratch, and if it can also potentially help other people, I get a much greater satisfaction from doing the work.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a small town in Oregon and being in a more rural area helped to cement my love of the outdoors and wild places. </p>
