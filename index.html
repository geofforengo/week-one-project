      <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Geoffrey Orengo</strong> and thank you for visiting my site! It is a work in progress but hopefully it will help you learn a little bit about me.</p>
      <p>I grew up in a small town in Oregon and being in a more rural area, plus many wonderful family camping trips helped to cement my love of the outdoors and wild places.</p>
      <p>I attended college after high school and received a Bachelor of Arts with honors in Anthropology. I pursued a subject I was interested in, and had seriously considered pursuing a postgraduate degree in Anthropology. I decided not to pursue post-graduate studies in that field due to multiple factors, and found myself in a scarce job market. I worked briefly as a parking lot attendent before being hired as a letter carrier by the US Postal Service. I worked there for over 16 years until deciding that I wanted to have a more marketable skill set and something that was not quite so physically taxing. I looked at multiple bootcamps and thankfully found <em>Epicodus</em>. I have only a small amount of experience so far, but it seems to be an excellent program, credited to enthusiastic teachers and a well conceived curriculum. </p>
      <p>There were several reasons I decided to pursue programming. I've always wanted to better understand computers, and I also enjoy work I find intellectually stimulating. I also enjoy the feeling that comes from creating something from scratch, and if it can also potentially help other people, I get a much greater satisfaction from doing the work.</p>
      <p>I have a wide variety of interests, including literature, art, video games, comedy, and the outdoors. I tend to be curious and have enjoyed many museum trips and OMSI After Dark events. I also like visiting the Oregon coast regardless of the time of year.</p>
