        <p>I've always wanted to better understand computers, and also enjoyed work that I find intellectually stimulating. I also enjoy the feeling that comes from creating something from scratch, and if it can also potentially help other people, I get a much greater satisfaction from doing the work.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a small town in Oregon and being in a more rural area helped to cement my love of the outdoors and wild places.</p>
        <p>I attended college after high school and received a Bachelor of Arts with honors in Anthropology. I pursued a subject I was interested in. Due to multiple factors, I decided not to pursue post-graduate degrees in that field, and found myself in a scarce job market. I had a brief stint as a parking lot attendent before being hired as a letter carrier by the US Postal Service. I worked there for over 16 years until deciding that I wanted to have a more marketable skill set and something that was not quite so phsically taxing. I looked at multiple bootcamps and thankfully found Epicodus. I have only a small amount of experience so far, but it seems to be an excellent program, mostly due to enthusiastic teachers and well conceived curriculum.</p>
